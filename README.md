This is the fifth assignment of week 5.
 I completed this assignment as three steps. First,add real time presentation. Second, create three colored schedules: grey, red and green. In the grey (i<3)and green parts(i<5), use for loop to repeat in the function. Third, add "localstorage" function which store tempory memory after refreshing the page.
  All classes' settings in js file as "createElement" and "setAttribute",because the css style file has be created. Then, use classname.appendChild(anotherclass) to show layers in the html. 
  What's more, fubnction save(i) and function show() to set storage function. The localstorage and the index of i controls it. i keep adding from 0 to 9.
  However, I confused on scrolling down bar. I added a function to set  but it seems to useless because the html page has scrolling bar as defult.
