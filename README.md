This is the fifth assignment of week 5. Totally, there are nine i (i<9) setting in show() function.
 I completed this assignment as three steps. First,add real time presentation. Second, create three colored schedules: grey, red and green. In the grey (i=0,i<3)and green parts(i=4,<9), use for loop to repeat in the function. Third, add "localstorage" function which store tempory memory after refreshing the page.
  All classes' settings in js file as "createElement" and "setAttribute",because the css style file has be created. Then, use classname.appendChild(anotherclass) to show.
  However, I confused on scrolling down bar. I added a function to set  but it seems to useless because the html page has scrolling bar as defult.
